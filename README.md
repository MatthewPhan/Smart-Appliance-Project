# Smart-Appliance-Project

## Quick-Start Guide:
1)	First configure the various AWS services and roles (Refer to Section 3 - Software setup instructions) 
2)	Update the credentials file on both the input and output RPi as well as the EC2 webserver
3)	Run weather.py and smart_appliance.py on the input RPI
4)	Run output.py on output RPI
5)	Run populate_s3.py to populate baseline images to the S3 bucket (Note: Baseline images should be in the same folder as well)
6)	Run the ‘sudo -s’ command on the EC2 server before running the server.py file

## Hardware checklist:
-	1 DHT11 sensor
-	1 LED
-	1 LCD screen
-	1 SW-420 Vibration Sensor
-	1 BMP 180 Pressure Sensor
-	1 Buzzer
-	3 Buttons
-	1 Picamera

## Hardware setup instructions:
1)	The SW-420 vibration sensor has 3 pins namely the digital output, GND and VCC pin. The data pin can be used to connect with any GPIO pin and the voltage suitable for the sensor is 3.3V to 5V however it is recommended to use 3.3V. 
2)	The BMP-180 pressure sensor has 4 pins namely the SDA, SCL, GND and VCC pins. Connect the jumper wires accordingly and connect it to the SDA, SCL and GND pins on the breadboard. As for the VCC pin it is also recommended to use 3.3V.
