# Smart-Appliance-Project

## Quick-Start Guide:
1)	First configure the various AWS services and roles (Refer to Section 3 - Software setup instructions) 
2)	Update the credentials file on both the input and output RPi as well as the EC2 webserver
3)	Run weather.py and smart_appliance.py on the input RPI
4)	Run output.py on output RPI
5)	Run populate_s3.py to populate baseline images to the S3 bucket (Note: Baseline images should be in the same folder as well)
6)	Run the ‘sudo -s’ command on the EC2 server before running the server.py file

## Hardware checklist:
-	1 DHT11 sensor
-	1 LED
-	1 LCD screen
-	1 SW-420 Vibration Sensor
-	1 BMP 180 Pressure Sensor
-	1 Buzzer
-	3 Buttons
-	1 Picamera

## Hardware setup instructions:
1)	The SW-420 vibration sensor has 3 pins namely the digital output, GND and VCC pin. The data pin can be used to connect with any GPIO pin and the voltage suitable for the sensor is 3.3V to 5V however it is recommended to use 3.3V. 
2)	The BMP-180 pressure sensor has 4 pins namely the SDA, SCL, GND and VCC pins. Connect the jumper wires accordingly and connect it to the SDA, SCL and GND pins on the breadboard. As for the VCC pin it is also recommended to use 3.3V.

### E) EC2 Set-Up
  1. Navigate to EC2 service in the AWS console
  2. Find the Launch Instance section in the EC2 dashboard and clock on the orange button to “Launch Instance”.
  3. Select ‘Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)’ and choose the option for 64-bit (x86)
  4. For the next step, select ‘t2.micro’ for the instance type. Then click the button ‘Next: Configure Instance Details’ below.
  5. For configuring instance details, enable the “Auto-assign Public IP” option. Then scroll down to find the “Advanced Details” section and enter the following commands in the “User data” text box. Once done, click the “Next: Add storage” button below the webpage.
  6. In “Step 4: Add Storage”, do not make any changes and leave everything as default. Click the “Next: Add Tags” button below.
  7. In “Step 5: Add Tags”, click the “Add Tag” button. Input the key and value according to the table shown below. Once done, click the “Next: Configure Security Group” button.

  13. Connecting to EC2 via WinSCP
  14. Download the needed dependencies
  15. Steps to run which python program

### F) Creation of S3 bucket
  1. Open the S3 service in AWS console and click on “Create bucket”
  2. Type “Smart-Appliance-Bucket” as name and select AWS region as “US East 1 (North Virginia)”. Use the default values for the rest of the option. FInally, click the “Create Bucket” button.
  3. The bucket is then created on the S3 console as shown below
 
### G) Configure AWS Rekognition and S3
  1. Configure AWS rekognition to allow us manage collection containers (which is stores the
face feature vectors)
  ```bash
  aws rekognition create-collection --collection-id family_collection --region us-east-1
  ```
  2.  Create a DynamoDB Table to maintain a reference of the FaceID returned from Rekognition and the full name of the person.
  ```bash
     aws dynamodb create-table --table-name family_collection \
    attribute-definitions
    AttributeName=RekognitionId,AttributeType=S \ --key-schema
    AttributeName=RekognitionId,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput
    ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1 \
    --region us-east-1
  ```
  
  3. Create a bucket to store the images
  ```
    aws s3 mb s3://smart-appliance-bucket --region us-east-1
  ```
  4. Create a trust and access policy. Note that you should replace aws-region, account-id, and the actual name of the resources (e.g., bucket-name and family_collection) with the name of the resources in your environment.
  - These two policies allows the AWS Lambda Role (created in step 5) to
    a) to access the objects from Amazon S3,
    b) initiate the IndexFaces function of Amazon Rekognition,
    c) create multiple entries within our Amazon DynamoDB key-value store for a mapping between the FaceId and the person’s full name.
  - trust-policy.json
  - access-policy.json
  
  5. Create an IAM service role for AWS Lambda, by the following two commands:
```
    aws iam create-role --role-name LambdaRekognitionRole --
    assume-role-policy-document trust-policy.json

    aws iam put-role-policy --role-name LambdaRekognitionRole --
    policy-name LambdaPermissions --policy-document accesspolicy.json
```

### H) Configure AWS Lambda for Face-Mapping Detection
  Create the Lambda function that is triggered every time a new picture is uploaded to Amazon S3. Create the function using the Author from scratch option.
  1. Search for “Lambda” in the AWS console and select it.
  2. Enter the following field:
  3. As seen below, the Lambda function role is created.
  4. Select “Add trigger”.
  5. On the configure triggers page, select S3, and the name of your bucket as the trigger. Then configure the Event type and Prefix as shown in the following example. This ensures that your Lambda function is triggered only when new objects that start with a key matching the index/pattern are created within the bucket. Remember to check the “I acknowledge..”.
  6. Copy and Paste the Lambda_Facemapping.py from into the Function Code.
  7. Select “Deploy”. Upon successful deployment, “Changes deployed” would be listed.
  8. Select the “Permission” tab, and click “Edit”.
  9. Change the “Existing role”, with the Role we created earlier (LambdaRekognitionRole). Click “Save”.
 
 ### I) Create an AWS SNS Topic, Subscribe and Create SNS Rule
  1. Search the Amazon AWS console for the SNS service, choose “Topics” at the sidebar and select “Create Topic”.
  2. Choose “Standard” and enter the topic name and display name.
  3. Take note of the ARN of the topic that is just created.
  4. On the same page, select the button “Create subscription”
  5. Under “Create subscription”, select “email” as the option under Protocol. Type in the email account in the endpoint as follows (Note: The email account can be your personal email however our group decided to create a new email for this assignment):
  6. Head over to the Gmail account and confirm the subscription. Successful confirmation would look like the following picture
  7. In the AWS IoT console, in the left navigation pane, choose “Act”, then “Create a rule”
  8. On the Create a rule page, enter the following:
  9. In ‘Set one or more actions’, choose Add action.
  10. On the Select an action page, select ‘Send a message as an SNS push notification’, and then click ‘Configure action’.
  11. On the Configure action page, from the SNS target drop-down list, choose the Amazon SNS topic created earlier ‘forgotpassword’.
  12. On the Configure action page, create a new role for this rule
  13. Choose Add action.
  14. Choose Create rule.
  15. On the Overview page for the rule, choose the left arrow to return to the AWS IoT dashboard.
